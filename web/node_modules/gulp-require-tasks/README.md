# gulp-require-tasks

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/gulp-require-tasks.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/gulp-require-tasks)


This convenient module allows you to load *Gulp* tasks from the
multiple individual files and directory hierarchy.


## Features

- Loads individual task files recursively from the specified directory
- The name of the task is inferred from the directory structure, e.g. `styles:preprocess:clean`
- Easily integrates into the `gulpfile.js` without breaking your existing tasks
- Gulp instance and task callback are automatically passed to your task function
- Very flexible: almost all aspects of the module is configurable
- Each task is stored in it's own local node module to completely separate concerns


## Installation

### Install library with *yarn*

`yarn add -D gulp-require-tasks`


## Usage

Create a directory alongside your `gulpfile.js` to store your individual
task modules, e.g. `./gulp-tasks`. Place your tasks into this directory.
One task per JavaScript file. Use sub-directories to structure your tasks.

Load tasks from your `gulpfile.js`:

```js

// gulpfile.js:

// Require the module.
const gulpRequireTasks = require('gulp-require-tasks');

// Invoke the module with options.
gulpRequireTasks({
  
  // Specify path to your tasks directory.
  path: process.cwd() + '/gulp-tasks' // This is default!
  
  // Additionally pass any options to it from the table below.
  // ...
  
});

// Or, use minimal invocation possible with all options set to defaults.
gulpRequireTasks();

```


### Minimal Gulp file possible

```js
// gulpfile.js:
require('gulp-require-tasks')();
```

Or with options:

```js
// gulpfile.js:
require('gulp-require-tasks')({
  separator: '.'
});
```


## Options

| Property     | Default Value     | Description
| ------------ | ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------
| path         | `'./gulp-tasks'`  | Path to directory from which to load your tasks modules
| separator    | `:`               | Task name separator, your tasks would be named, e.g. `foo:bar:baz` for `./tasks/foo/bar/baz.js`
| passGulp     | `true`            | Whether to pass Gulp instance as a first argument to your task function
| passCallback | `true`            | Whether to pass task callback function as a last argument to your task function
| gulp         | `require('gulp')` | You could pass your existing Gulp instance if you have one, or it will be required automatically


## Task module format

Consider you have the following task module: `gulp-tasks/styles/build.js`.


### Module as a function

You could define module as a task function. Gulp instance and
callback function would be passed to it, if not configured otherwise.

You could configure the library to pass additional arguments as well.

```javascript

// gulp-tasks/styles/build.js:

const compass = require('compass');

module.exports = function (gulp, callback) {
  return gulp.src('...')
    .pipe(compass())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('...'))
  ;
};
```


### Module as an object

Also, you could define your task module as an object.
This will allow you to provide additional configuration.

```javascript

// gulp-tasks/styles/build.js:

const compass = require('compass');

module.exports = {
  deps: ['styles:clean', 'icons:build'],
  fn: function (gulp, callback) {
    return gulp.src('...')
      .pipe(compass())
      .pipe(gulp.dest('...'))
    ;
  }
};
```

You will have to define your task function as `fn` parameter.
You could use `deps` parameter to define your task dependencies.

Also, you could use `nativeTask` instead of `fn` property to make your
task function executed by Gulp directly. That way, additional arguments
will not be passed to it. This feature is useful when using,
e.g. [gulp-sequence][gulp-sequence] plugin or for [synchronous tasks](#synchronous-tasks).


### Task function return value

To make sure, that task is finished correctly you must either:

- Return a proper Gulp stream from the task function, e.g.: `return gulp.src().pipe(gulp.dest());`
- Return a valid Promise (thenable object), e.g.: `return del();` or `return new Promise();`
- Call a callback function passed to it, e.g.: `callback();`

> WARNING: If your task function is synchronous — please read the section below!


### Using root directory tasks

Starting from version `1.1.0` you can place `index.js` inside of the task directories.
The actual task, registered with Gulp will have the name of the directory itself,
e.g.: `scripts/build/index.js` will become: `scripts:build`.

The `index.js`, placed in the root of tasks directory, will be registered as a `default` task.


### Passing data to the task function

If you need to pass something to the task function from your gulpfile you can use globals.

Define your custom properties on the `global` object:

```js
// gulpfile.js

global.SOURCES_BASE_PATH = __dirname + '/src';
```

And then use it in your task module:

```js
// gulp/tasks/styles/build.js
module.exports = gulp => 
  gulp.src(global.SOURCES_BASE_PATH + '/styles/*.scss')
    .pipe(compass())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('…'))
;
```


### Synchronous tasks

If you are using synchronous tasks, i.e. tasks which execute synchronously
without returning streams, promises or accepting callbacks, you will have
to use one of the workarounds specified below:

1). The simplest method is to use `nativeTask` functionality, here's the
example of the module with native task synchronous function:

```js
module.exports = {
  nativeTask: function () {
    console.log('This is the synchronous native task without a callback!');
  }
};
```

2). You should call a callback explicitly:

```js
module.exports = function (gulp, callback) {
  console.log('This is the synchronous native task with explicit callback!');
  callback(); // Don't forget this, otherwise task will never finish!
};
```

However, if `config.passCallback == false` you won't be able to use the second method.

These workarounds must be used due to architectural limitation of this module integration with orchestrator.
Please see the issue
[#9: Synchronous tasks without callback don't finish](https://github.com/betsol/gulp-require-tasks/issues/9)
for more technical details.
